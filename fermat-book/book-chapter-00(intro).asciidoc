== Introduction
In the last 20 years virtually everything went digital: pictures, music, videos, mails, etc. Nevertheless we still have cash as paper money. Even with all the advancements in electronic management of money (ATMs, Payment processors, wire transfers, credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit and online billpay, etc) they are all the digital representation of paper currency. It was not until the sucessful implementation of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology based in math, criptography and distributed consensus, that a brand new replacement for the entire concept of money[1] appeared to be possible. It simplifies the exchange of goods and services in the current stage of modern living based on internet at the same time that promises a completely new paradigm of the exchange of values between people, based on opennes, decentralization and privacy.
The technology is becoming more popular in the last years as a considerable amount of fin tech venture capital has been flowing into startups dealing with it, but at present time, mass adoption seems to be too far away in the future despite of all money, time and effort devoted to achieve it.
Here is the starting point of Fermat as a community of developers, graphic designers, academics, artists, and people of the industry trying to address this big challenge of crypto currencies and blockchain technology becoming mass adopted: to build the bridge between the technology and end users, startups, brand or institution worldwide.

=== The Vision

The Fermat Community believes that the upcoming decade will witness *crypto currencies* going mainstream and governments issuing digital currency as well. They expect that *paper money* is going to _disappear_ within the next years. Thus a strong consumer demand for *digital wallets* and for *financial applications* will inevitably emerge. In order to meet this demand thousands of different apps should be available, differentiating not only in terms of their funtionalities and the level of abstraction they apply (some of them showing crypto currencies while others digital fiat over crypto or even digital assets) but also with respect to their appearance and how they feel to the user, tailored to their culture, customs and way of living.

The Fermat Community is contributing to that future building a software system that makes easier the creation of new digital wallets and financial apps, and it opens this fascinating emerging industry beyond the scope of very skilled developers but to include new developers and even non-developers.

=== Fermat Community

Fermat is an Open Source project and there is an active community of developers, designers and academics contributing to it, beyond bitDubai, a network of teams that are the project's main maintainer.

The project started on August 2014 and its earliest version was written from January to May 2015 by a handful of people, the core developers team. From there on, as the concept began spreading, many more developers, graphic and UX designers, and some industry related people joined in.

Today Fermat is a vibrant community spanning several countries and disciplines.


=== What is Fermat as a software system ?
Fermat is a *peer-to-peer financial application framework*. +

It consists of three main parts: +

.  a P2P network for interconnecting devices
.  a plug-in framework for developing and running distributed financial applications and link:https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat/blob/master/fermat-book/book-glossary.asciidoc#wallet[wallets]. +
.  a system of integrated apps

The link:https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat/blob/master/fermat-book/book-glossary.asciidoc#framework[framework] itself it is an evolution of standalone wallets and also of centralized wallet services, because it extends the functionality of wallets and financial applications to a trust-less (or trust-free) decentralized environment that handles both _crypto currencies_ and _digital assets_. This independence from third parties makes Fermat censorship resistant and hard to attack the same way it was intended at the creation of Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin network. +

Fermat allows developers and specially non-developers to create their own distributed (i.e. living on the user's devices) financial applications (wallets are considered a special kind of financial applications) reusing or combining other previous financial applications or some of its components that are built into Fermat as plug-ins. +
The core concept of Fermat is to divide the *_transport of meta-data_* (carried by the Fermat network) from the *_transport of value_* (carried by proven crypto networks like BitCoin being accesed by the lower layers of the Fermat framework).

In this way Fermat builds a *full stack* of decentralized applications from the existing blockchain protocols up to the end user.
The existing gap between the available but complex crypto networks technology  and the end user is bridged by consecutive abstraction layers, beginning with a first layer of _reference financial applications and wallets_ that are programmed to solve only a specific set of tasks. Then, these simple "bricks"  are combined to offer together a set of functionalities to a second layer of  _niche financial applications and wallets_ that are developed to address different use cases, one at a time. A third layer of  _branded financial applications and wallets_ combine niche fin apps/niche wallets and reuse their components in a sort of "WordPress for fin apps" making possible that non developers add their own touch and create a new fin app/wallet of their unique style. (*brand*). +
The joint service of Fermat network connecting devices and Fermat framework running on the user's devices act as a _back-end_ for a fourth layer of distributed trust-less applications that manage crypto currencies and digital assets and are fully decentralized and for this, censorship resistant and hard to attack.

The goal of Fermat is to allow any company, big or small, brand or institution to have their financial application or digital wallet with *any* subset of the whole functionality built collectively by the entire software industry community. +
Fermat's architecture includes also the possibility of interconnecting the trust-less financial applications developed within its framework to the existent legacy financial system.


=== Fermat's Purpose

  * Empower every person in the world with the appropriate tools to save and move their money digitally in a more efficient, secure and private way.

  * Give back the sovereignty over to each personâ€™s own resources, respecting the freedom of choice about which currency to use and how to administrate it, regardless of the place they live or where they were born.

=== Fermat's Mission

 *  To get crypto currencies mass adopted as soon as possible.
 *  To allow end users, startups,  brand or institution to have their financials applications.
 *  To build the best possible integrated system able to handle the finances not just of all the human world population but also of companies and machines in the context of the link:https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat/blob/master/fermat-book/book-glossary.asciidoc#IoT[IoT] (Internet of Things).

=== The challenge

After the pioneer step of Nakamoto who gave rise to *Bitcoin* and its revolutionary blockchain technology, there has been a lot of fin tech investment money given to a myriad of startups initiating in this industry in the last years. This fostered the next evolutionary step, *"crypto currency 2.0"* but it has still not reached the level of adoption expected. There seems to exist an unbalance between the considerable investment of funds and efforts needed to master this technology plus the results they are bringing up. Furthermore, isolated projects trying to build something useful starting form zero have it difficult to obtain the necessary support and the persistent endurance needed to succeed... +
Precisely acknowledging this weak points in the industry, and choosing *collaboration* within a *master plan* as a starting point, its how the Fermat community believes to succeed in solving the challenges set in their mission and purpose by building a complete new framework that solves the problem in an efficient, inclusive and attractive way.

The design of Fermat addressed the answers to the following questions:

  *  How can the perception of complexity on crypto currencies be isolated from common people?
  *  How can the collective intelligence of the developer community be used?
  *  How can the entire current infrastructure already in place be reused?
  *  How can legacy financial institutions be integrated in a way they feel comfortable?
  *  How can merchants, retailers and brands of all sizes be integrated in a clever way?
  *  How can non-developers be allowed to create digital wallets without programming anything at all?

The answers to each of these questions are addressed within Fermat.
