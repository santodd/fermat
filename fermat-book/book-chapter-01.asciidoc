== Chapter 1: Fermat Master Plan

Fermat has its own vision of how to carry out the collaborative project of their Open Source software. The main concept is to define a large master plan far into the future, and start building it by phases, adjusting the target when needed. It is designed this way to absorb the efforts of thousands of contributors over the years into a unified architectural vision. It is somehow translating into the industry the useful experience of building a "concept city" like Dubai starting by designing a master plan to guide the necessary tasks and development phases. +

=== Phase I: Foundations
The goal is to have a framework for developing financial applications in a trust-less environment. What are the services that had to be granted at the lower levels to enable this?

The basic infrastructure ::
The _Fermat Core Platform_ is the part of the system which initializes the entire set of components, starting every plug-in and putting them to run. This creates the interconnection that lets all the services to be offered as being integral part of one unified system.
The basic services ::
** Connection to different Operating Systems that will run Fermat on any chosen device.
** Interconnectivity to crypto networks and blockchain services providers to enable the *transport of value*.
** P2P communication of the devices running Fermat to enable the *transport of information (meta-data)*
The plug-ins environment ::
_Fermat Plug-ins Platform_ deals with this task allowing system users to be identified, low level plug-ins to be recognized as part of the system and communication services to link plug-ins living in different devices and so on. In general terms, all these allow various _network services_ to run and start building the set of functionalities that will be taken by the applications built on top.

NOTE: At this stage of development, Fermat already offers a wide scope of REUSABLE components for third parties to build on top of, encouraging further development of the plan and enriching it with every single addition.


=== Phase II: First structures
The foundations have been laid out, but to reach the end user oriented applications, it is necessary to create several functionalities. In order to make a visible structure available for further developments and also to provide certain focus to related functionalities, these are wrapped in substructures of the Fermat system called *platforms* and *superlayers*. Each of them groups a subset of functionalities that offer the following services:

* A decentralized Wallet production line
* A crypto currency platform to manage the transference of value through crypto transactions
* A shopping platform that links shop owners with brands and their customers
* A digital asset platform to allow issuing a vast type of digital coupons exchangeable for services and products
* A marketing platform based on digital assets
* A crypto broker platform to easily administrate the business of exchanging crypto and fiat currency
* A crypto distribution network to create local commercial environments fostered by crypto money

among others...

=== Phase III and beyond:
Have you grasped the _potential_ of Fermat yet? Can you imagine the next phases of development?
Are you interested in getting to know more about phase I and II? +
